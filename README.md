This repository culminates all my learning from the course "Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning" offered by VLSI System Design (VSD).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The course is about introducing to open source EDA tools (openLANE flow), and Skywater 130nm open pdk and it also includes floorplanning, standard cell design, pre-layout timing analysis and CTS.

DAY 1:
INCEPTION OF OPEN SOURCE EDA, OPENLANE, AND SKY130 PDK

The day started with the introduction to RISC-V ISA, openLANE and concluded with synthesizing the PICORV32 design and analysis the results and reports.

First, what is a RISC-V ISA:
  An ISA descirbes the the set of instructions that the processor can execute, supported registers and data type. It is basically the programmer's manual as it is used by compiler designers and assembly language programmers.
  Now there are a sequence of steps followed to produce the final instruction for a particular application (Firefox) to run as shown in fig 1.1.
